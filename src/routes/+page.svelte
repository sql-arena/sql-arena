</div>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<article>
	<p>SQL Arena is an independent project that aims to provide comparative data between database vendors.
		This should help you make informed decisions about which database to use for your next project and
		tell you where to expect issues.
	</p>

	<p>Data rendered on this website is collected using a tool called <code>dbprove</code>.</p>

	<p>All tooling used by SQL Arena are open source under the Apache License. People interested in databases
		are invited to contribute (see: <a href="/dbprove/">DBProve</a>).</p>

	<p>In the cases where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_DeWitt">DeWitt Clause</a> allows it
		&mdash; performance metrics will be measured. For other cases, vendors will either be excluded or
		measurements not related to performance will be published.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<ListComponent components="{data.components}" />
<article>
	<p>Data is divided into components that roughly match the typical, architectural stack of a relational database.
	</p>
</article>


<h2>Queries and Analysis</h2>
<article>
	<p>Queries are bundled into workloads (for example: TPC-H).
		After each query run a post-hoc analysis is done to determine how well the query
		was executed by the database engine. The focus is not just on runtime, but also
		on what we can say about the database engine based on the observed behaviour of the query</p>

	<p>The automated Analysis Includes such things as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Runtimes broken into their components (when the engine supports it)</li>
		<li>Query Plan shapes and relational operator usage</li>
		<li>Latency Measurements</li>
		<li>CPU cycle breakdown when viable â€” falling back estimation when the engine is lacking instrumentation.</li>
		<li>I/O detailed analysis using whatever instrumentation is available</li>
	</ul>
